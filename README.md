# Step 3.  Workflows

Workflows are often a second thought on most Generative AI applications.  Its critical to capture all the different possibilities and places that a GenAI app will need to get data.  Not all of it comes from the Vector Database, and often there are better, easier more effective and effcient ways to get things done.

## 4 Steps to Building a GenAI Application
There are 4 steps to building a GenAI Application and I have included a github for each step.    
The githubs (some still work in progress) are indexed here:   
Step 1. Data Augmenatation: [Confluent-Kafka-Vector-Encoding](https://github.com/brittonlaroche/Confluent-Kafka-Vector-Encoding)   
Step 2. Inference: [Confluent-Kafka-Vector-Search-Prompt-Inference](https://github.com/brittonlaroche/Confluent-Kafka-Vector-Search-Prompt-Inference)   
Step 3. Workflows: [Confluent-Kafka-Vector-Search-Workflows](https://github.com/brittonlaroche/Confluent-Kafka-Vector-Search-Workflows)   
Step 4. Post Processing: [Confluent-Kafka-Vector-Search-Post-Processing](https://github.com/brittonlaroche/Confluent-Kafka-Vector-Search-Post-Processing)
